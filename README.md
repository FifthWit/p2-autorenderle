# Autorenderle
A web game based off of [Rankdle](https://rankdle.com/) using Portal 2 individual level speedruns.

## How to Play
Portal 2 IL speedruns automatically have a video made if they're apart of the top 200 fastest times on a level. Videos are "rendered" using demos that runners submit as proof alongside their run. Autorenderle uses those automatically rendered videos, or "[autorenders](https://autorender.portal2.sr/)", to create a game where you can guess the rank or runner of a specific video.

## Gamemodes

### Guess the Rank
In this gamemode, you are given a video and you must guess the rank of that time on the map's leaderboards from 1 to 200. There's an element of trust here as you could simply look up the time (if the autorender shows it) on the IL leaderboards and look at the rank from there.

Streaks are based on how far you are from the correct answer. If you are less than 10 ranks away from the correct answer, then your streak increases.

### Guess the Runner
In this gamemode, you are given a video of a top 40 run on a map and the choice of four runners. Use movement techniques and routes to determine whose run the video belongs to. Streaks are based off guessing the correct answer.

If you have gamemode suggestions, DM Jaio#7900 or make a GitHub issue.
